    - •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is ____."
  •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."

1. Straightforward Prompts
Prompt 1: 👉 "Define modulation in one sentence." Response: Modulation is the process of varying a carrier signal to transmit information efficiently.

Prompt 2: 👉 "List three modulation techniques used in satellite communication for multimedia signals." Response: The three commonly used modulation techniques are Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK).

2. Tabular Format Prompting
Prompt 1: 👉 "Provide a table comparing AM, FM, and QPSK modulation techniques in terms of signal quality, bandwidth, and application."

Response:

3. Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt 1: 👉 "Why is modulation necessary in satellite communication? Explain how QPSK helps in multimedia transmission." Response:

Modulation is necessary to efficiently transmit signals over long distances, minimize interference, and make efficient use of bandwidth.
QPSK allows transmission of 2 bits per symbol, which increases data rate and ensures reliable multimedia communication.
Prompt 2: 👉 "How does FM provide better quality compared to AM in satellite communication? Explain with reason." Response:

FM provides better quality because it is less sensitive to amplitude noise and interference compared to AM.
This makes FM more suitable for audio and video broadcasting over satellites.
4. Missing Word Prompting
Prompt 1: 👉 "In satellite communication, modulation is used to improve ____." Response: Transmission efficiency.

Prompt 2: 👉 "QPSK modulation encodes ____ bits per symbol." Response: 2 bits per symbol.
